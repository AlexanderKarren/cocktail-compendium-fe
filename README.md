## Description

The Cocktail Compendium is a community-driven web app that acts as a succinct cocktail recipe book. The app is designed to make not only the recipe submissions as easy as possible but also navigating recipes submitted by other users. No ads or lengthy stories to scroll past to get to the recipes, and of course, the app is free for anyone to use.

Non-admin users will have to submit their cocktails for approval by an admin to be listed on the main page.

### Build 2 - 2020-09-11
